        The Sharjah Fisheries Authority was established in 2022, implementing
        the vision of His Highness Sheikh Dr. Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi, may
        God protect him, to preserve and develop fishery resources in the
        emirate, and achieve and enhance food security. The Authority aims to
        revive the profession of our ancestors, the profession of fishing, and
        elevate it by supporting the local market and providing all available
        forms of support to fishermen and their activities across the emirate.
